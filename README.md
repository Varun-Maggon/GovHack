This is readme for project that demonstrates a fully working solution for GovHack challenge **"Use AI to transform bureaucratic jargon into plain English"**

The link for the challenge can be found [here](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/use_ai_to_transform_bureaucratic_jargon_into_plain_english).

### Problem Statement:
How can we use AI to create clear, accurate and user-friendly government content? Specifically, how can we use AI tools to apply Australian Government Style Manual (Style Manual) rules and guidelines to create, edit and review content?
Content that is clear, accurate and understandable helps people make informed decisions and comply with their obligations.

### Solution:
This solution aims to leverage AI to transform bureaucratic government content into clear, accurate, and user-friendly information. The focus is on operationalizing the Australian Government Style Manual's guidelines, improving inclusivity, accessibility, and accuracy, while integrating AI into existing workflows for measurable benefits.
